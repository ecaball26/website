		    Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), otherwise known as 3-dimensional instruction, is an effort to move STEAM education's goal from a memorization of facts and and concepts to a focus on student's ability to as an investigator and designer. The standards were initially released in 2011 and published in 2013, providing states with an option to adopt the new standards.</p>
		<p>
			The 3 dimensions include Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), Cross Cutting Concepts (CCCs), and Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs). SEPs puts forth the expectation that students should adopt 8 practices that mimic the experiences of scientists and engineers. Cross Cutting Concepts refers to the idea that all science domains hold the same underlying themes. Lastly, Disciplinary Core Ideas includes the concept of domain specific content with 2-4 core ideas for each domain. Each dimension has a set of performance expectations instead of an expected list of knowledge that students must master.

			Phenomena is also a core portion of 3D instruction and is defined as a natural occurence that can be observed and bring about curiousity. Educators are encouraged to use phenomena as the foundation of lessons and units. This serves as an organic method to foster a students ability to engage with relevant scientific examples and practice utilizing their knowledge and skills to explain a phenomenon or work towards a solution.
