            <h2>Kilig and What Not â™¡</h2>
	    <h4>~A Place Where I Yap My Little Lover Girl Heart Away and Live Out All My Future Grandma Stories~</h4>
	    <p>Okay, so, this is really just an effort to keep myself accountable about writing regularly and record keeping without driving myself or my friends insane about dating stories. All names and personal details outside of my own have been changed, but iykyk LOL</p>

            <p>Can you comfortably, if not, enthusiastically, leave your new beau alone with your friends and family?</p>

		<h2>Embracing the Kilig</h2>
	        <h4>~Celebrating the Green Flags and Remembering My Love of Solitude~</h4>
                <p>Did I absolutely crash out and ask chatgpt to examine the chances of Fifi faking all of this? Yes, I absolutely did. </p>
	        <p>Confirmed-- my toxic avoidant attachmnent traits are oozing out of my pores and my initial instinct that he has a genuine and thoughtful nature was correct. Essentially, chatgpt confirmed that each of the dates and his communication have centered around creating an inviting space where I feel seen, heard, and comfortable.</p>
		<p>I'm incredibly grateful that I'm at a point in my life where I recognize how important separation and space are at the start of any relationship. I absolutely cannot text regularly nor can I see the person more than twice a week. Otherwise, like clock work, I will have a hysterical melt down about the implications of a new beau. After a full 24 hours without seeing him or feeling kilig because he does something cute, I have resumed my normal life. I usually relish my time away from any new beau,using that time to return to my regular habits, but especially when I am becoming unreasonable.</p>
		<p>My time driving to the gym and going through my PT exercises is exactly why I have this rule. As I was driving and treating my car like my own personal dance club, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. This feeling of freedom and true happiness was a somatic reminder as to why I have built my life so specifically in the last couple of years and why I can't fly away in the wind with these feelings, good or bad. I truly love my single life of solitude. My life has so much joy and levity folded into every part of my day and I have worked for every bit of that. It's because of this that I can't readily spend my time thinking of him and the possible outcomes. I also can't turn to dating more people merely because of my desire to run away from my feelings of insecurity. In reality, I just to enjoy my time to myself as I have in the past 3 years. Also, in the spirit of optimism, if I am truly scared by all of the signs pointing to him being a potential partner, it also means that I may not be single again for a long time or maybe ever again. So, even then, I should savour these fleeting momements of single-dom.</p>
		<p>Other things that helped me: M saying that "all men will hurt you, it might as well be the one that you really like", watching my vlog from last summer about the diffculty of completely removing the reminents of long term relationships, and remembering my motto of "to be seen"</p>

	    <h5> My main takeaway: He has the kind of presence where I felt so safe and happy to be the most genuine version of myself. Looking back, I can barely recall what we talked about because I just lived in that moment with him.</h5>
