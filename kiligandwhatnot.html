            <h2>Kilig and What Not â™¡</h2>
	    <h4>~A Place Where I Yap My Little Lover Girl Heart Away and Live Out All My Future Grandma Stories~</h4>
	    <p>Okay, so, this is really just an effort to keep myself accountable about writing regularly and record keeping without driving myself or my friends insane about dating stories. All names and personal details outside of my own have been changed, but iykyk LOL</p>

            <h2>My New Perspective on Dating</h2>
	    <h4>~The Birthday Party Litmus Test~</h4>
            <p>Can you comfortably, if not, enthusiastically, leave your new beau alone with your friends and family?</p>

		<h2>Embracing the Kilig</h2>
	        <h4>~Celebrating the Green Flags and Remembering My Love of Solitude~</h4>
                <p>Did I absolutely crash out and ask chatgpt to examine if there's any chance Fifi is faking all of this? Yes, I absolutely did. </p>
	        <p>I did confirm that I am absolutely leaning into my toxic avoidant attachmnent traits and I can trust my initial instinct that he is showing sings of being a genuinely kind and thoughtful man who is interested in me. Essentially chatgpt confirmed that that each of the dates and the communication that he has done has centered around creating an inviting space where I feel seen, heard, and comfortable.</p>
		<p>I am also so glad that I know myself well enough to put some space between us in the beginning. I absolutely cannot text regularly outside of making plans. I also can't see the person more than 1-2 times a week in the beginning. Otherwise, I will have a full on melt down and about what this could mean for my life. Now that I have had a full 24 hours without seeing him or feeling kilig because he does something cute, I feel like I have regained my normal life. I love taking time away from communicating with a new beau and enforcing my regular habits, especially, when I am becoming unreasonable.</p>
		<p>My time driving to the gym and going through my PT exercises is exactly why I have this rule. As I was driving and treating my car like my own personal dance club, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. This feeling of freedom and true happiness was an instant somatic reminder as to why I have built my life so specifically in the last couple of years and why I can't fly away in the wind with these feelings, good or bad. I truly love my single life of solitude. My life has so much joy and levity folded into every part of my day and I have worked for every bit of that. This is why I can't be readily spend so much time thinking of him and if we will be long term. I also can't just date more people because I'm insecure about how things could turn out and I want to run away from that feeling. In reality I just to enjoy my time to myself like I usually do. On the otherhand, in the spirit of optimism, if I am truly scared by all of the signs pointing to him being a potential partner, it also means that I may not be single for a long time or maybe ever again. So even then, I should reallyyyy enjoy these fleeting momements of single-dom.</p>
		<p>Other things that helped me: M saying that "all men will hurt you, it might as well be the one that you really like" and watching my vlog from last summer about the diffculty of completely removing the reminents of long term relationship</p>

	    <h5> My main takeaway: He has the kind of presence where I felt so safe and happy to be the most genuine version of myself. Looking back, I can barely recall what we talked about because I just lived in that moment with him.</h5>
