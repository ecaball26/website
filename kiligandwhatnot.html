            <h2>Kilig and What Not â™¡</h2>
	    <h4>~A Place Where I Yap My Little Lover Girl Heart Away and Live Out All My Future Grandma Stories~</h4>
	    <p>Okay, so, this is really just an effort to keep myself accountable about writing regularly and record keeping without driving myself or my friends insane about dating stories. All names and personal details outside of my own have been changed, but iykyk LOL</p>

            <h2>My New Perspective on Dating</h2>
	    <h4>~The Birthday Party Litmus Test~</h4>
            <p>Can you comfortably, if not, enthusiastically, leave your new beau alone with your friends and family?</p>

		<h2>Embracing the Kilig</h2>
	        <h4>~Celebrating the Green Flags and Remembering My Love of Solitude~</h4>
                <p>Did I absolutely crash out and ask chatgpt to examine the chances of Fifi faking all of this? Yes, I absolutely did. </p>
	        <p>Confirmed-- my toxic avoidant attachmnent traits are oozing out of my pores and my initial instinct that he has a genuine and thoughtful nature was correct. Essentially, chatgpt confirmed that each of the dates and his communication have centered around creating an inviting space where I feel seen, heard, and comfortable.</p>
		<p>I'm incredibly grateful that I'm at a point in my life where I recognize how important separation and space are at the start of any relationship. I absolutely cannot text regularly nor can I see the person more than twice a week. Otherwise, like clock work, I will have a hysterical melt down about the implications of a new beau. After a full 24 hours without seeing him or feeling kilig because he did something cute, I have resumed my normal life. I usually relish my time away from any new beau,using that time to return to my regular habits, but especially when I am becoming unreasonable.</p>
		<p>My time driving to the gym and going through my PT exercises is exactly why I have this rule. As I was driving and treating my car like my own personal dance club, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. This feeling of freedom and true happiness was a somatic reminder as to why I have built my life so specifically in the last couple of years and why I can't fly away in the wind with these feelings, good or bad. I truly love my single life of solitude. My life has joy and levity in almost every fold of my day and I have worked for every bit of that. It's because of this that I can't readily spend my time thinking of him and the possible outcomes. I also can't turn to dating more people merely because of my desire to run away from feelings of insecurity. In reality, I just want to enjoy time to myself as I have in the past 3 years. Also, in the spirit of optimism, if I am truly scared by all of the signs pointing to him being a potential partner, it also means that I may not be single again for a long while or maybe ever again. So, even then, I should savour these fleeting momements of single-dom.</p>
		<p>Other things that helped me: M saying that "all men will hurt you, it might as well be the one that you really like", watching my vlog from last summer about the diffculty of completely removing the reminents of long term relationships, and remembering my motto of "to be seen"</p>

            <h2>Date #1 with Fifi</h2>
	    <h4>~hugs, laughs, closing time, and my favorite love language --- roasting~</h4>
            <p>I looked up to see an attrative man with the most endearing, gentle smile, and felt my nerves start to slip away.</p>
	    <p>Fav Topics: our transition from rule followers to full on chaotic-good folks</p>
	    <h5> My main takeaway: He had the kind of presence where I felt so safe and happy to be the most genuine version of myself that night. Looking back, I can barely recall what we talked about because I just lived in that moment with him.</h5>

            <h2>Date #2 with Fifi</h2>
	    <h4>~Knitting and being a Sleepy Gal~</h4>
            <p>I cannot fathom that I am already feeling that sleepy lover girl coma with him. </p>

    	<div class="card">
            <h2>Date #3 with Fifi</h2>
	    <h4>~Paint and Sip~</h4>
            <p>It was endearing to see him try so hard on his painting. My initial assumption was that he would be incredibly carefree and goofy about the class. I was completely wrong. He was trying so hard that he forgot about his wine,sighing at each new step, even occasionally falling behind. After a while, he relaxed and I started sighing away about my finishing touches. (p.s. he's a taurus)</p>

<p>We even went to one of my favorite Filipino restaurants! I loved sharing the food with him and also getting to ask more hot seat questions about relationships. We talked about our dating history, thoughts on drugs, what we've judged each other about (LOL), personality types, intercultural dating, if we've had a type, which seventh deadly sin we're the most  guilty of.</p>

<h5>post date reflections:</h5>

<p>I lost a bit of my playful approach after realizing how interested I am in him, but I've remembered that it's one of life's greatest pleasures to learn about the little things in a new person.</p>
<p> The fear of how a relationship could change my life also set in. Thankfully, I was reminded that I've intentionally looked for a new partner whose characteristics and lifestyle can complement and grow with my own.</p>

<h5>main takeaways:</h5>


<ol>
  <li>Pls, for the love of god, stand-up girl. There are better things to use your brain space for. This is literally a man. </li>
  <li>You're 26, you're not going to royally fuck this up. You're kind, thoughtful, and intelligent, so any mistakes you make are because you are human and learning. (you can be a taxi can too lololol)</li>
  <li>It's not about being "ready" to be in a relationship,  its about finding someone who fits into your life and vice versa </li>
<li>Come as you are. It's okay to show the less glamorous sides of you. Put your best foot forward, but it's okay to let the ocassional grumpiness or sassiness come out on the shitty days.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note to self: need to ask him to teach me how to surf!! silly goose, these are the kinds of things you would love to do with a partner</p>

		<h2> Dating Update - June 17th, 2025</h2>
		<p>We're now on our 4th date and he's seen some of non-glamorous portions of my personality and is still here. So I feel like I'm finally at a point where I've accepted that a man now regularly occupies a space in my life. For how long? Who nows? But it is just my current reality.</p>
