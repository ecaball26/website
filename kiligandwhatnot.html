	    <h4>~A Place Where I Yap My Little Lover Girl Heart Away and Live Out All My Future Grandma Stories~</h4>
	    <p>Okay, so, this is to keep myself accountable about writing regularly and record keeping without driving myself or my friends insane about dating stories. All names and personal details outside of my own have been changed, but iykyk LOL</p>

            <h2>My New Perspective on Dating</h2>
	    <h4>~The Birthday Party Litmus Test~</h4>
            <p>Can you comfortably, if not, enthusiastically, leave your new beau alone with your friends and family?</p>

		<h2>Embracing the Kilig</h2>
	        <h4>~Celebrating the Green Flags and Remembering My Love of Solitude~</h4>
                <p>Did I absolutely crash out and ask chatgpt to examine the chances of Fifi faking all of this? Yes, I absolutely did. </p>
	        <p>Confirmed-- my toxic avoidant attachmnent traits are oozing out of my pores and my initial instinct that he has a genuine and thoughtful nature was correct. Essentially, chatgpt confirmed that each of the dates and his communication have centered around creating an inviting space where I feel seen, heard, and comfortable.</p>
		<p>I'm incredibly grateful that I'm at a point in my life where I recognize how important separation and space are at the start of any relationship. I absolutely cannot text regularly nor can I see the person more than twice a week. Otherwise, like clock work, I will have a hysterical melt down about the implications of a new beau. After a full 24 hours without seeing him or feeling kilig because he did something cute, I have resumed my normal life. I usually relish my time away from any new beau,using that time to return to my regular habits, but especially when I am becoming unreasonable.</p>
		<p>My time driving to the gym and going through my PT exercises is exactly why I have this rule. As I was driving and treating my car like my own personal dance club, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. This feeling of freedom and true happiness was a somatic reminder as to why I have built my life so specifically in the last couple of years and why I can't fly away in the wind with these feelings, good or bad. I truly love my single life of solitude. My life has joy and levity in almost every fold of my day and I have worked for every bit of that. It's because of this that I can't readily spend my time thinking of him and the possible outcomes. I also can't turn to dating more people merely because of my desire to run away from feelings of insecurity. In reality, I just want to enjoy time to myself as I have in the past 3 years. Also, in the spirit of optimism, if I am truly scared by all of the signs pointing to him being a potential partner, it also means that I may not be single again for a long while or maybe ever again. So, even then, I should savour these fleeting momements of single-dom.</p>
		<p>Other things that helped me: M saying that "all men will hurt you, it might as well be the one that you really like", watching my vlog from last summer about the diffculty of completely removing the reminents of long term relationships, and remembering my motto of "to be seen"</p>

            <h2>Date #1</h2>
	    <h4>~hugs, laughs, closing time, and my favorite love language --- roasting~</h4>
            <p>I looked up to see an attrative man with the most endearing, gentle smile, and felt my nerves start to slip away.</p>
	    <p>Fav Topics: our transition from rule followers to full on chaotic-good folks</p>
	    <h5> My main takeaway: He had the kind of presence where I felt so safe and happy to be the most genuine version of myself that night. Looking back, I can barely recall what we talked about because I just lived in that moment with him.</h5>

	    <h4>~Knitting and being a Sleepy Gal~</h4>
            <p>I cannot fathom that I am already feeling that sleepy lover girl coma with him. </p>

            <h2>Date #3</h2>
	    <h4>~Paint and Sip~</h4>
            <p>It was endearing to see him try so hard on his painting. My initial assumption was that he would be incredibly carefree and goofy about the class.</p>
 <p>I was completely wrong.</p>
<p> He was trying so hard that he forgot about his wine,sighing at each new step, even occasionally falling behind. After a while, he relaxed and I started sighing away about my finishing touches. (p.s. he's a taurus)</p>

<p>We even went to one of my favorite Filipino restaurants! I loved sharing the food with him and also getting to ask more hot seat questions about relationships. We talked about our dating history, thoughts on drugs, what we've judged each other about (LOL), personality types, intercultural dating, if we've had a type, which seventh deadly sin we're the most  guilty of.</p>

<h5>Post Date Reflections:</h5>

<p>I lost a bit of my playful approach after realizing how interested I am in him, but I've remembered that it's one of life's greatest pleasures to learn about the little things in a new person.</p>
<p> The fear of how a relationship could change my life also set in. Thankfully, I was reminded that I've intentionally looked for a new partner whose characteristics and lifestyle can complement and grow with my own.</p>

<h5>Main Takeaways:</h5>


<ol>
  <li>Pls, for the love of god, stand-up girl. There are better things to use your brain space for. This is literally a man. </li>
  <li>You're 26, you're not going to royally fuck this up. You're kind, thoughtful, and intelligent, so any mistakes you make are because you are human and learning. (you can be a taxi cab too lololol)</li>
  <li>It's not about being "ready" to be in a relationship,  its about finding someone who fits into your life and vice versa </li>
<li>Come as you are. It's okay to show the less glamorous sides of you. Put your best foot forward, but it's okay to let the ocassional grumpiness or sassiness come out on the shitty days.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note to Self: need to ask him to teach me how to surf!! silly goose, these are the kinds of things you would love to do with a partner</p>

		<h2> Dating Update - June 17th, 2025</h2>
		<p>We're now in a consistent rhythm and he's seen some of the non-glamorous portions of my personality and is still here. So I'm finally at a point where I've accepted that a man now regularly occupies a space in my life.</p> 
<p>For how long? Who knows ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's just my current reality.</p>
<p>Truly thankful thats he took the time to communicate even during a hard week for him. it does so much for my anxious attachment tendencies. Also I can totally tell that I'm getting comfortable with him bc I'm kind of looking forward to annoying him next week</p>
<p> Okay nvm, crashing out a little bc i feel like he's going to ghost me </p>

<p>06.25.25 ---- Nvm, its just my anxious attachment. Bb is literally going through it with his family and so am I. We deserve that irreplaceable honeymoon phase and not settling for the little energy that we can cobble together right now. Definitely willing to wait so we can enjoy dates full of laughter and mischief. P.S. Truly losing my mind and praying that this is the last man bc I almost went to church to pray about this today LMAO. I am also annoyed at him because 1) give the other men a fighting chance. Why take me on my own hometown date and then follow-up with my dream date?! 2) I am peeved that, YOU, my friends have already mounted your horses in his defense. You haven't even met this man yet!! You're supposed to be my friends!!</p>

			06.25.25 ---- Nvm, its just my anxious attachment. Bb is literally going through it with his family and so am I.

		<p>
			06.29.25 ---- Okay, so everyone was right, he was not ghosting me. He messaged a week later and was engaged about my updates and expressed his appreciation of the time/space that I gave him (kind of hate how that's phrased because everyone deserves that kind of love and it's not something that should be given or taken away by others)
		</p>
		<p>
			What I found most interesting was my determination to give him that space despite my struggles with my anxious attachment. I would have rather gone to church and pray (its been years since I've done this for myself) or listen to a dhamma before interrupting bb's peace of mind. I can't tell if this is because of my personal determination to grow out of anxious attachment and foster a healthy romantic foundation or because he reallys makes me want to be better or a combination of both.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have obviously had my own struggles and growth with my anxious attachment -- from my anxiety attacks after arguments with NY to tumultuous spirals because of goy. After NY, I set a new precedent --if I start becoming someone I don't recognize, then I must accept its not the relationship for me. With goy, I learned that just because I can continue to be myself outside of the turmoil, does not mean it's a relationship I should accept. After those two, I promised myself that I would take a gentler and slower pace that would allow the necessary time to be introspective about my instinctual anxious attachment reactions. So, in part, that's why I'm taking the time to listen to more dhammas, to write this blog, to go to the gym, to write notes for Miss R, and do literally anything else than prematurely disturb bb's peace. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I also promised myself that I would try to find someone who doesn't bring out those anxious traits unnessarily. For this, I've tried to use my new perspective of "would my friends and family love this person for me?" Honestly, it might have been one of my greatest epiphanies. I know it seems tired and old, but this works especially for me because I am unbelievably lucky to have the people that I have. *DISCLAIMER: THE NEXT PART IS SO CHEESY I WANT TO PUT MYESLF ON TIME-OUT* All of bb's words and actions affirms that this was the exact decision I needed to make for myself. He has been a steady follow of thoughtfulness, kindness, communication, and humor. The way that he communicates with openness and gentleness reassures my little heart. Inevitably, my dumb little heart already wants to be better for him (about my anxious attachment) because I know that bb deserves that and that's the what I want to give him.
		</p>
		<p>
			06.30.25 my new delusional coping mechanism so I don't have to deal with anxious attachment tendencies: pretend like I'm sure he's going to be my husband one day so I can bask in my freedom while I have it.
