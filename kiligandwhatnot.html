            <h2>Welcome to My Blog Silly Gooses!!</h2>
	    <h4>~A Place Where I Yap About Virtually Anything and Everything~</h4>
	    <p>Okay, so, this is really just an effort to keep myself accountable about writing regularly and record keeping for all the progress that I make towards grad school (and whatever else comes after that).</p>

            <h2>A and B Schedules</h2>
	    <h4>~My Perfect Schedule as An ADHD Adult~</h4>
            <p>Due to my hyperfocusing tendencies, it is often more exhausting to try to stick to a neurotypical schedule (i.e. the same routine that includes task switching often). Instead, I like to stick to what I call an "A and B schedule." The name is inspired by the schedules often given to middle school students and high schools students. As an adult, I have taken this and used it so that I had days where I mostly focus on work and have small maintence tasks on my A days and for my B days, I focus on my other life goals (e.g. deep cleaning my home,writing my blog, long runs, knitting, etc.) I like to think my "B Day Schedule" is more about the hobbies that allow me to stay center but also re-energized.</p>

            <h2>Weekend Routines and Prioritizing the Tasks that Make Me Feel Alive</h2>
	    <h4>~My Perfect Schedule as An ADHD Adult~</h4>
            <p>If you know me, you would know that I loveeee to work on the weekends. As someone that can often get overstimulated but also loves to work on many projects, I can often get distracted by the small tasks that pop-up through the week. So I love working on the weekends when it's quieter. I know, I know, working on the weekends sounds terrible. I'm fortunate enough to love what I would do (I would still do this if I was the richest person in world). However, I've found it a little hard to catalyze any productivity when I try to use my weekday schedule. So this morning, I gave myself the space to breathe and just knit. I had to remind myself and say "you work on the weekends to get ahead not because you're required to." After I finally relaxed into my knitting I found myself happy and in Gen-Z terms "not ready to off myself" at the thought of working on a Sunday.</p>
	    <h5> So that's my main takeaway: on the weekends, I need to schedule my mornings so that I've blocked time off for the things that make feel alive (e.g. knitting, reading at a cafe, going on a trail run, gardening, etc) and then I can saunter or skip into the office in the afternoons.</h5>

            <h2>More Community and Creation, Less Consumption</h2>
	    <h4>~Resting and Resilience~</h4>
            <p>I know that we're all feeling it. Fortunately, wisdom and love surrounds me and rememebered that despite all the work there is to be done, there is also a consistent need to feed our foundations. I have intentionally leaned into scheduling more time with my loved ones, whether it looks like spending a sunday driving to my cousins place or texting more friends to check-in, and also creating like the writing putting together for this blog. These couple weeks have already like a couple of months. I can't imagine how much longer they would have felt without this passed wisdom. </p>
