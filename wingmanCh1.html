           top and left correspond to the top-left corner of your box. What you're trying to do is have them correspond to the center. So if you set margin-top and margin-left to negative of one-half the height and width respectively, you'll get a centered box.

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <h5>June 2026</h5>
		
      <p>
	      I have always believed that friendships are the life source of any worthwhile existence.
      </p>
		
      <p>
	      That is why I am now running across 56th street in Manhatten, New York. It is an unusually sweltering and humid evening, proven by my sweat soaked button-up and glistening forehead. 
      </p>

      <p>	
	      Had this been any other party, I would be lesuirely strolling in, late by a couple hours. As I reach the stairs of my best friends apartment, I slow my pace and catch my breathe. Although I had promised to be on time, I had also promised to be on my best behavior. Sweat-soaked and out of breathe definitely didn't fit that criteria. As I reach the 3rd floor and make a left to the rooftop, I can already hear the music and chatter between my friends. As I get closer to the crowd, I see ballons arranged to say "Happy 35th" and look around to look for my best friend Naz. I spot Naz next to the firepit with his sweet girlfriend chatting away with our friend Justin. I weave and bob through the crowd dancing my way over to them. 

      </p>
	      "You made it man!" Naz says with his typical cool and welcoming demeanor
	      “Happy birthday! And, of course, I couldn't miss out on my girl. Where is she anyways?” I say to my best friend.
	      "Your girl? Essie? She's already at the apartment making drinks for everyone," Naz says as he shakes his head and laughs at our inside joke. This joke of ours, or more so my joke, started about a year ago when Naz casually mentioned Essie.

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <h5>2 years prior</h5>
      <p>
	      “Who do you think would make a better ‘wing-person’, a woman or a man,” Marisol says as I warily merge into the left lane. <br>

“A woman, 100%, but, wait, where is this coming from, ” I say as I try to make another horrid merge onto the Bay Bridge.  <br>

Sol, as I affectionately refer to my best friend of over a decade, goes onto explain a bet she has made with her new(-ish) boyfriend. I’m still very much adjusting to the idea of my wild, child best friend having a partner, but I’m very much trying to welcome him into our lives. Naz has been able to provide the gentle, loving presence that I always hoped Sol would find. She’s opened up to him to the extent that everyone finally sees the bright and deeply loving person I’ve know since I was 12. So if it means listening to her trivial, drunken night bets with her finance bro boyfriend and his friends, then so be it.  <br>

Naz is apparently trying to set-up his college best friend post a horrendous break up. All my brain can process is *something*, *something*, “the ex sent messages at 2am to his friend”, “he quit his job to move across the world for her”, “now he has blonde hair.” It’s really all my tired brain can process. I go on to tell her all about my best wingwoman tips because, up until recently, I was the Queen of all things love and happy endings.  <br>

A break up with the love of your life will do that to you. Well, at least, I thought he was the love of my life. Recently, I have been doing everything in my power to keep it together. Everyone, from Sol to even my sweet halmeoni* has been keeping a close eye on me. The last time Minjun and I had broken up, my whole world was turned upside down. I had almost quit school, I didn’t talk to anyone for months, and I had even considered becoming a Buddhist nun. Yes, we all still laugh at that last part. I would not have survived a month without all of my favorite foods. This time around, I’m at least trying to keep it together on the outside. I could already see Sol’s concern at my puffy eyes when we loaded our luggage into the back of my car this morning. Did I sob my eyes out for 2 hours last night because I found the handwritten list of restaurants Minjun made for what should have been our whirlwind international summer trip? Yes, yes I did. Was I going to tell my darling best friend after she bailed on her new boyfriend and their first Italy trip just so she could take the place of my shitty ex on this trip? Not at all.
