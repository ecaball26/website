           top and left correspond to the top-left corner of your box. What you're trying to do is have them correspond to the center. So if you set margin-top and margin-left to negative of one-half the height and width respectively, you'll get a centered box.

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <h5>June 2026</h5>
		
      <p>
	      I have always believed that friendships are the life source of any worthwhile existence.
      </p>
		
      <p>
	      That is why I am now sprinting across 56th street in Manhatten, New York. It is an unusually sweltering and humid summer evening, proven by my sweat soaked button-up and glistening forehead. 
      </p>

      <p>	
	      Had this been any other party, I would be lesuirely strolling in, late by a couple hours. As I reach the stairs of my best friends apartment, I slow my pace and catch my breathe. Although I had promised to be on time, I had also promised to be on my best behavior. Sweat-soaked and out of breathe definitely didn't fit that criteria. As I reach the 3rd floor and make a left to the rooftop, I can already hear the music and chatter between my friends. As I get closer to the crowd, I see ballons arranged to say "Happy 35th" and look around for my best friend Naz. I spot Naz next to the firepit with his sweet girlfriend, Marisol, chatting away with a group of our other friends. I weave and bob through the crowd, dancing my way over to them. 

      </p>
      <p>
	      "You made it man!" Naz says with his typical cool and welcoming demeanor <br>
	      “Happy birthday! And, of course, I couldn't miss out on my girl. Where is she anyways?” I say to my best friend.<br>
	      "Your girl? Essie? She's already at the apartment making drinks for everyone," Naz says as he shakes his head and laughs at our inside joke of 2 years. <br>
	      "She's being a menace and making her signature mango rum cocktails to fuck everyone up. I think she's a bit nervous" Marisol interjects, whispering the latter half. <br>
	      "Mari!" I say as I envelope petite Marisol in a bone crushing hug making her giggle. <br>
	      "Hi Teo, happy to see you too. Let's go get some of those mango cocktails?" She says with a mischievious smile. <br>
	      "Yeah, you guys go ahead. Let me just get some water and I'll be right behind you" I say to Naz and Mari.<br> 
      </p>
      <p>
	     It makes absolutely zero sense for me to get water here when we are heading to Naz's apartment, but I'm relieved that they both look past my nonsensical excuse to postpone seeing Essie for another minute.
	     It's one of my favorite traits that they share, their ability to let others exist, faults and all, without making other people self-conscious.
	     I quickly gulp my water down and find Marisol a few steps ahead of me quietly poking at Naz as he throws back his head in his wide-grinned laugh.
	     I adore the way they so seemlessly fit into one another as they saunter down the stairs.
	     I've always wanted what they've been lucky enough to find, but its been challenging the last couple of years.
	     For the most part I've lost hope, but seeing them always rekindles a small portion of my hopeless romantic tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
	     As Mari opens the door, all I can register is a drunken, loud, slur of "Sol!!" and a blur of light purple tackling me to the ground. 
      </p>
      <p>
	     I look up to see a tanned woman with long, thick disheveled wavy hair, crooked square glasses, flushed cheeks, and incredibly bewildered eyes. As soon as she registers I am not Marisol, she scrambles up and dusts off her skirt.
      </p>
      <p>
	     "Oh dear god, you're not Sol" she says as her cheeks flush to be even redder than before.<br> 
	     "Quite observant. Yes, I'd have to about a foot shorter. You must be Essie," I say to her with a cheeky grin. Looks like Naz was exactly right about her.

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <h5>2 years prior</h5>
      <p>
	      “Who do you think would make a better ‘wing-person’, a woman or a man,” Marisol says as I warily merge into the left lane.
      </p>
      <p>

“A woman, 100%, but, wait, where is this coming from, ” I say as I try to make another horrid merge onto the Bay Bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
Sol, as I affectionately refer to my best friend of over a decade, goes onto explain a bet she has made with her new(-ish) boyfriend. I’m still very much adjusting to the idea of my wild, child best friend having a partner, but I’m very much trying to welcome him into our lives. Naz has been able to provide the gentle, loving presence that I always hoped Sol would find. She’s opened up to him to the extent that everyone finally sees the bright and deeply loving person I’ve known, since I was 12. So if it means listening to her trivial, drunken night bets with her finance bro boyfriend and his friends, then so be it.  <br>

Naz is apparently trying to set-up his college best friend post a horrendous break up. All my brain can process is *something*, *something*, “the ex sent messages at 2am to his friend”, “he quit his job to move across the world for her”, “now he has blonde hair.” It’s really all my tired brain can process. I go on to tell her all about my best wingwoman tips because, up until recently, I was the Queen of all things love and happy endings.  
      </p>
      <p>
A break up with the love of your life will do that to you. Well, at least, I thought he was the love of my life. Recently, I have been doing everything in my power to keep it together. Everyone, from Sol to even my sweet halmeoni* has been keeping a close eye on me. The last time Minjun and I had broken up, my whole world was turned upside down. I had almost quit school, I didn’t talk to anyone for months, and I had even considered becoming a Buddhist nun. Yes, we all still laugh at that last part. I would not have survived a month without all of my favorite foods. This time around, I’m at least trying to keep it together on the outside. I could already see Sol’s concern at my puffy eyes when we loaded our luggage into the back of my car this morning. Did I sob my eyes out for 2 hours last night because I found the handwritten list of restaurants Minjun made for what should have been our whirlwind international summer trip? Yes, yes I did. Was I going to tell my darling best friend after she bailed on her new boyfriend and their first Italy trip just so she could take the place of my shitty ex on this trip? Not at all.

	<h2>my college sweetheart</h2>
	<p> park chan wook and nadine</p>
	<p>ch 1 - September 2017, flashback to 2017 frat party</p>
	<p>insert actual meet cute and end at the accidental happy birthday and nadine being embarassed. they go to cal</p>
	<p>ch2 - September 2031</p>
	<p>Nadine's POV. Nadine's day as head of research development. Establish Nadines charater as the older version of herself. Working on a new project and having a project conversation where she is asking associate to find a new person who can do imaging because current imaging isnt going fast enough. N tells her associate that she read about a new faster imaging tech and asks associate to find 4 possible new consultants. Casual conversation. Nadine has zero idea that Chan is the new hot shot researcher in this field with his own start-up company bc she told their mutual friends that she wants absolutely zero info about him starting in 2026. N felt that about hearing about his life and continuing to feel proud of him made her feel connected to him, but it kept getting in the way of new relationships so N cut it off.</p>
	<p>Ch 3</p>
	<p>Chan's POV. A shorter barbeque, catch-up diaglogue with Solomon. N & C meet again in this chapter. He is top canidate for a new consultant N's company is trying to hire. N's top associate had organized it and he is now going by his korean name instead of his american name. Nadine would be upset at him for interviewing despite knowing its her company. He's a simp and is trying to get N back and says "I thought you would care more about the impact we could make together over the fact that I'm your former boyfriend.(make it more formal)" Spends the dinner talking about how he wants to make amends (some hints about being in love with her still), but ruminating over whether or not it would be disrupting her new life. Sol is encouraging this and says chan's a different person. Sol asks "well you probably know her well enough, what do you think she'd really care about at the end of the day?"</p>
